Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD


Example 1:

Input:
A = 5 , B = 10
Output:
10 5
Explanation:
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while
thier GCD is 5.


class Solution {
    static Long[] lcmAndGcd(Long A , Long B) {
        long ans = gcd(A, B);
        long lcm = (A * B) / ans;

        Long[] arr = new Long[2];
        arr[0] = lcm;
        arr[1] = ans;

        return arr;
    }

    static long gcd(long a, long b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
