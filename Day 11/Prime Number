For a given number N check if it is prime or not. A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
1
Explanation:
5 has 2 factors 1 and 5 only.


class Solution{
    static int isPrime(int N){
        // code here
        
        int i=2;
        
        if(N<2)
        return 0;
        
        while(i*i<=N){
            if(N%i==0)
            return 0;
            i++;
        }
        
        return 1;
    }
}
